## 👨‍💻 About Me

I specialize in building **scalable backend systems**, clean REST APIs, and reliable web applications.

My primary focus areas include:
- Backend architecture
- Authentication & authorization (JWT, RBAC, OAuth)
- Database modeling
- Secure and efficient API design

While my strength is backend development, I also build complete end-to-end solutions when required.
